## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Apps:
Pinterest - Pinning photos to boards, searching for photos
Instagram - Posting stories with music, archiving posts
Strava - Map of run, posting details about the run in bio

An app idea I would like to build is an app that recommends gifts to people based on information you have inputted about them. This information does not have to be age, gender, ethnicity, etc, but more their hobbies, their favorite colors, past gifts, and overall vibe. Some features I would implement is the information page where you can input as much information as you like. I would implement the gift ideas to come up on the page with links to the entire gift/aspects of the gift so that users can easily click the link to buy a part of the gift. I would also potentially implement a way for users to upload gift ideas for others based on what they like.

## Notes

I had some challenges uploading the images into xcode. I figured out how to add an image with the plus button on the top right for UI but couldn't figure out how to actually insert the image. With some tinkering and online resources, I dropped the image file into the Assets portion and was able to upload the images.
